## Description

_These are 5 code solutions to problems distributed by Epicodus._

## Problems
Question #1: Turning Strings to URLs

URLs cannot have spaces. Instead, all spaces in a string are replaced with %20. Write an algorithm that replaces all spaces in a string with %20.

You may not use the replace() method or regular expressions to solve this problem. Solve the problem with and without recursion.
Example

```Input: "Jasmine Ann Jones"

Output: "Jasmine%20Ann%20Jones" ```

Question #2: Array Deduping

Write an algorithm that removes duplicates from an array. Do not use a function like filter() to solve this. Once you have solved the problem, demonstrate how it can be solved with filter(). Solve the problem with and without recursion.
Example

```Input: [7, 9, "hi", 12, "hi" 7, 53]

Output: [7, 9, "hi", 12, 53]```

Question #3: Compressing Strings

Write an algorithm that takes a string with repeated characters and compresses them, using a number to show how many times the repeated character has been compressed. For instance, aaa would be written as 3a. Solve the problem with and without recursion.
Example

```Input: "aaabccdddda"

Output: "3ab2c4da"```

Question #4: Checking for Uniqueness

Write an algorithm that determines whether all the elements in a string are unique. You may not convert the string into an array or use array methods to solve this problem. The algorithm should return a boolean.
Example

```Input: "hello"

Output: false

Input: "copyright"

Output: true```

Question #5: Array Sorting

Write an algorithm that sorts an array without using the sort() method. There are many different sorting algorithms - take the time to read about the following:

    Quick sort
    Merge sort
    Heap sort
    Insertion sort
    Bubble sort
    Selection sort

You may implement any of the above algorithms (or your own) to solve the problem - as long as it doesn't use sort().
Example

```Input: [9, 2, 7, 12]

Output: [2, 7, 9, 12]```
