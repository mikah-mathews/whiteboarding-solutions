removing duplicates from an array
input is array, output is array
use a loop to go through each item in array
have array that each first occurrence is added to
if array already contains an occurrence don't add it
return uniqueOccurrenceArray

let deduping = function(array) {
  let uniqueOccurrences = [];
  for(let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    if (!uniqueOccurrences.includes(array[i])) {
      uniqueOccurrences.push(array[i]);
    }
  }
  return uniqueOccurrences;
}
