Question #2: Array Deduping

Write an algorithm that removes duplicates from an array. Do not use a function like filter() to solve this. Once you have solved the problem, demonstrate how it can be solved with filter(). Solve the problem with and without recursion.
Example

```Input: [7, 9, "hi", 12, "hi" 7, 53]

Output: [7, 9, "hi", 12, 53]```

for loop
have output array where unique occurrences will get added
when finished going through for loop, return outputArray

let arrayDeduping = function(inputArray) { 
  let uniqueOccurrences = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < inputArray.length; i++) {
    if (!uniqueOccurrences.includes(inputArray[i])) {
      uniqueOccurrences.push(inputArray[i]);
    }
  }
  return uniqueOccurrences;
}
